For my final, I want to use the three.js library to make a 3d portfolio website. I already have experience with 3D modeling and texturing, so most of the work will be getting the hang of three.js.

* One substantial "showcase asset"
* Scroll functionality that pans around/utilizes the asset in some way 
* Overlay text with information
